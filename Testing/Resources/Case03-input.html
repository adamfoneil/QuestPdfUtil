<div><span style="font-weight: bold;">Spay Neuter Veterinary Services, LLC uses qualified staffing and approved materials for all procedures performed. It is important for you to understand that the risk of injury or death, although extremely low, is always present just as it is for humans who undergo surgery. Carefully read and understand the following before signing your name.</span></div><div><br /></div><div>I, acting as owner or agent of the pet named above, hereby request and authorize Spay Neuter Veterinary Services, LLC, through whomever veterinarians they may designate, to perform an operation for sexual sterilization of the animal named on the above portion of this form.&nbsp;A) I understand that the operation presents some hazards and that injury or death of such an animal may conceivably result, for there is some risk in the procedure and the use of anesthetics and drugs in providing this service.&nbsp;B) I either certify that my animal has been vaccinated within one year prior to this date or waive my right to protect my animal by having it vaccinated, or request recommended vaccinations at the time of surgery. I understand that it takes up to two weeks for vaccinations to protect my animal.&nbsp;C) I understand that Alabama law requires that dogs and cats 3 months or older must be vaccinated for rabies and that my pet will receive a vaccination if I do not have their current rabies certificate to verify compliance with this law.&nbsp;D) I understand the inherent risks of failing to maintain current vaccinations and waive all claims arising out of or connected with the performance of this operation due to such failure. E) I certify that my animal is in good health and has had no food since 12:00 midnight the evening prior to surgery.&nbsp;F) I understand that Spay Neuter Veterinary Services, LLC has the right to refuse service to any animal to whom surgery is deemed a health risk. G) I understand that Spay Neuter Veterinary Services, LLC may not perform a complete physical examination before surgery is performed. I also understand that my animal will not receive pre-operative bloodwork unless requested by me or required by the examining veterinarian, and I am advised that bloodwork may reveal subclinical illness which may indicate my pet is at a higher risk of complications, including death from anesthesia, surgery, and/or subclinical illness, which has the potential to become clinical with anesthesia and/or surgery. H) I understand that all patients (except feral cats) receive the Capstar/Flea treatment which is necessary for quickly killing fleas prior to surgery and is only effective for approximately 24-48 hours. I) I understand that Capstar will not protect my pet from contact with fleas in the future.&nbsp;J) I understand that an NSAID is prescribed and used for pain management. Potential side effects include: gastrointestinal ulceration or bleeding (often seen as dark, tarry stools), and/or renal or hepatic impairment. I understand pain medication should be discontinued if symptoms occur and a veterinarian notified immediately.&nbsp;K) I understand that some factors significantly increase surgical risk, including but not limited to pregnancy, post-partum, heat cycle, and diseases such as Feline Immunodeficiency Virus, Feline Leukemia, and heartworms.&nbsp;L) I understand that if my animal is pregnant, the pregnancy will be terminated at surgery.&nbsp;&nbsp;M) I understand I will incur an additional charge for any of the following: in heat, pregnant, pyometra, umbilical hernia, cryptorchid (undescended testicles) neuter, presurgical bloodwork and pet weight over 50 lbs.&nbsp;N) I understand that if after sedation my pet is found to be already spayed or neutered, I will receive a refund minus the cost of sedation, and I will not receive a refund if an abdominal exploratory is performed.&nbsp;O) I understand that microchipping my pet has the very rare risk of hematoma development at the injection site.&nbsp;P) I understand that if my animal has fleas, ticks, or worms, it may be treated and I will be charged.&nbsp;Q) I understand that if I don't retrieve my pet at the agreed upon time that Spay Neuter Veterinary Services, LLC will exercise its right to either turn the animal over to the nearest humane society or dispose of as deemed just and proper as allowed by the State of Alabama under sections 35-11-390 and 35-11-391. Owners of pets left after the agreed date and time shall be charged a boarding fee of no less than $10 per night.
